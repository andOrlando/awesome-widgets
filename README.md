#awesome-widgets

yep it's another awesomeWM thing of mine.

Basically it's just a collection of widgets that are kinda material-design-y that should be able to
work in your configuration too. There's a couple stipulations: Since it comes directly from my
config, basically all external libraries (which should only be rubato, or maybe color at some point)
are prefixed with `lib` and I don't really wanna add them to lua path since I only use them for
awesome, so thats something you'd have to fix. The second stipulation being that they all rely on
said external library.

At some point I'll probably put some gifs here, but for now I'm too lazy.

TODO:
